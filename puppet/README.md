# Puppet 

* Puppet is building a product to help teams deploy cloud-native applications and manage their infrastructure with event-driven ops workflows.
* It's called Relay and is available at [https://relay.sh](https://relay.sh)
* Relay uses Tekton under the hood as its execution engine.  We found that using Tekton accelerated our development timeline by several months due to its capabilities and active community.
* Puppet is a CDF founding member. Our developers and product managers are working upstream on Tekton to fix bugs, implement features, and help define standards in the sig-interoperability working group.
