# Puppet 

* Puppet is building a product to help teams deploy cloud-native applications and infrastructure
* It's currently (Aug 2019) in private beta and the working name (not what it'll ship with!) is [Project Nebula](https://puppet.com/project-nebula)
* Nebula uses Tekton under the hood as its deployment engine. We found that using Tekton accelerated our development timeline by several months due to its capabilities and active community.
* Puppet is a CDF founding member. Our developers and product managers are working upstream on Tekton to fix bugs, implement features, and help define specifications
